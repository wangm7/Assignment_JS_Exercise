   * In most cases you can use Arrow Functions over Functions, however you cannot blindly do this. Arrow Functions are a
   * shorter syntax to express a function and allow for you to compose simple functions in one line. Arrow Functions were
   * introduced as part of ES6, so you will still run into Function a lot. You should be familiar with both syntaxs though.
   * 
   * Keep in mind the result of the statement after an arrow function is returned to the calling statement.
